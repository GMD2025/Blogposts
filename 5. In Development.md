Dear reader, we're learning bugs today — not the beetle type, but close enough — in fulfillment of our devotion to the science of entomology. or at least to game development.

At that time we had a quite buggy game and thus decided to focus most of our time in fixing issues we accumulated in development. Below is the brief summary of the bug fixes and new features we introduced in this milestone:

- animation bugs (building placing, resource popup)
- procedural symmetric 2d tilemap generation for 2-nd player
- AI Navmesh bugs
- navigation obstacles runtime resizing
- architectural improvements
- stoneman building
- fix of the symmetrical appearance of the tilemap logic
- auto sizing of buildings

We needed to make the playmap a symmetrical one and it was logical to accomplish that programmatically.
So we drew the half of the playmap once, employing the unity tilemap system and then the second half is generated from the first one but in a reflected appearance.
When we thought the feature was implemented to completion, we found a bug.
Upon adding a new layer of the tilemap, we noticed how its tiles tiles after "symmetrical" duplications shift in a surprising manner.

Auto sizing of the building was applied. The developer has to set the size of each building once through SO. Depending on the size set, all of the size based properties of the building are updated automatically.

We also want to note that we have streamlined and embraced agile fully in our workflow. It was the optimal solution to manage and schedule our work without wasting time on routine drills that most methods inherited from agile.

We needed to make sure that the process of task creation and modification was seamless and free from usual Jira overhead. That is why we employed a Jira plugin for Figma first, then after a while of using it and encountering the issues of plugin limitations switched to a natively Jira tool - Confluence. Both solutions employing the whiteboard with sticky notes give us the most crucial information regarding each task in a minimalistic form. We are nearing the conclusion of our exciting game development journey.
