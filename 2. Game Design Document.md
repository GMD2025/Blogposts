## High Level Concept

**Working title:** Citadelia / Tower Contest  
**Concept statement:** 2-player realtime tower-defense. Each player prepares his little town to withstand upcoming warriors and attacks of an opponent. You produce, you defend, and most importantly, attack. Each player manages his resources, and chooses his own vector of progression.  
**Genre:** strategic, tower-defense  
**Target audience:** 10+, analytical, mobile  
**Unique selling points:** 2 player games are scarce and fun to play during trips. 2 player game in tower defense genre is unique

## Product Design

**Player experience and game POV:** The player is a person who is looking for a challenging match of kingdoms to progress in ranking, win in-game rewards like new towers, building entities, etc.  
Building your own city is like growing something on your own \- it becomes special and you know every corner or even start naming things. It is his duty to protect this beauty and rejoice when your rival is failing.  
As the round progresses, the kingdoms become larger, the stakes rise, the battles become fiercer, the stakes are high.  
POV is top-down  
**Visual and audio:** [VISUALS ART-BOARD](https://www.figma.com/board/PHm3roV1mkPZR1UrZZMZ5v/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=Ftv9PrP9EdpfKsFa-1) Music based on Scarborough Fair \+ definitely Harpsichord **Game world fiction:** The setting of the game is a magical medieval world with some da Vinci inventions/mechanisms. **Monetization:** Online mode \+ skins  
**Platform, technology and scope:** mobile-first

## Detailed game systems design

**Core loops:** Setup resource production \-\> build defense structures \-\> build attack structures \-\> increase the efficiency of production and gain even more

**Objectives and progression:**

1. Learn to use different type of buildings  
2. Get comfortable with building strategy  
3. Get to know more advanced techniques.  
4. Try out new ways to evolve

**Game systems:** Cell-based field that can be filled with buildings. Build them using the resources gained over time. Buildings may also train/recruit warriors. That concludes to:

1. resource system  
2. warrior system  
3. attack system  
4. stats system (game balance)  
5. ? possibly, an evolution and upgrade system

**Interactivity:**

- Short-term cognizance (actions made in hurry)  
- Long-term cognizance (building made as preventive and security measures. With time, player realize, if strategy paid off or not)

Player drags the available buildings, looks for the opponent's actions, adapts.
