# Roll-a-ball
The very first assignment could not be simpler. 
I'm upset we couldn't follow some other tutorial as the first assignment.

It seemed to me that there's nothing wrong with doing a more complex tutorial, especially if it's a certified Unity tutorial. The reason behind those thoughts was that I had already done the exact same thing, twice in my life, and it seemed redundant to me.

Turns out, it wasn't so redundant after all - I have become rusty in Unity, its scripting, and some of its features. So it was a nice way to quickly recap and even improve some of the things.

Following the tutorial was super easy for me - I already knew where to find the properties mentioned in the text instructions, and knew what they are used for.

After completing the required tutorial, I went for a few modifications. Mainly, two things:
1. procedural spawning of obstacles and game points
2. tilting the plane instead of moving the ball around

The spawning algorithm takes into account the smart NavMesh component that is on a plane, and automatically adds the instantiated objects as NavMesh obstacles in order to include them to the map.

Tilting the plane was easy to script. I enjoyed how simple it was to implement a non-linear increase of the rotation (non-linear in terms of speed, so as in Motion Graphics, the speed graph is eased).  
Although, it took quite a time to tweak some properties to make the ball feel more real and lighter. By default, it accelerated as fast as a train (in a bad way) and it made it less agile and controllable.

I wanted the ball to the same as an actual metallic small ball - the ones kids play with. I'm confident most of us played with those, and they speed up drastically, instantly - you feel a constant feedback of each of your slightest movements.  
In the end, tired from trying to tweak the parameters, I started also giving an additional force to the ball on input. 

It feels a lot closer now to the real-world analog, although it upsets me - why would I need to apply an additional acceleration, an additional force out of nowhere? Why the physics simulation isn't imitating what I actually experience in real life?  
Well, most probably, it's my fault. Always could go deeper and maybe I just didn't search long enough for the right parameters. So, all in all, adding a force is an okay workaround for me!
