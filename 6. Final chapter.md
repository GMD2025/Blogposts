#### The game is ready üëç..?

A lot of work ahead... The game is running, the networking simply works - beautiful.
No bugs left to fix, no features we planned to add left.  
But something is missing?

#### Game mechanics

We were so fixated on finishing the ideas, on making things done, that in the process, we were putting the costs and the attacks and all other numbers at random.

And there is nothing wrong in that. It is just funny that it might seem that the game is done, but what is done is actually only the framework where the game is gonna be played in. The game itself has to be fine-tuned and it only makes sense to do it in the end, when all the systems are on the fly and you can test the game in action.

#### Not enough buildings
We feel the lack of variety of actions that the player can take. But we decided to put a period in that endless cycle of adding things - because it is enough buildings to play and understand the principle of the game, sort of Proof of Concept of the game.

#### How to fine-tune?
Our way of fine-tuning was just naive - intuition and poking around. And iterative plays. We still consider our game raw and unfun in a way. And we can't see a way to fix that rather than investing tons of time into developing the larger variety of stuff and warrior-units to send.

#### The backlog
Although, we did have the feature we did not implement but wanted to - we had an idea of "deploying the units on press".  
Meaning that instead of automatically being sent away on birth, they could gather around and they would deploy only when the players want them to, in bulk! All at once!  
We think it would add another dimension of tactics, another way to be unpredictable and wage your battle.  
But, unfortunately, it will stay in backlog. We don't have any time left to finish those ideas. 

But we were so glad to have you on the journey. See you on the 6th of June, which we really look forward to.
