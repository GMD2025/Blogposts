# Move a Cube

A simple Unity project demonstrating basic player movement, camera controls, and arena automation (partially).

## Description

This project is a school assignment. The game allows the player to move a cube through an obstacle course.

## Features

- Basic cube movement (WASD + jump)
- Keyboard and controller support
- Moving obstacles

## Arena (Partly Automatic Generation)

The arena’s walls, ramps, start/finish points, and plane can be adjusted by modifying the respective properties in the ArenaController. This saves a lot of time by automatically ensuring the geometrical accuracy of how objects and their dependent elements are transformed, without needing to manually update them.

What can be adjusted:

- Wall width and height
- Ramp angle (whatever angle is entered, the ramps remain attached to the walls)
- Ramp size (height and width)
- Plane size (resizes the whole arena, affecting walls, ramps, and checkpoints)
- TODO: Checkpoint size

Changing any of the properties listed above updates the scene automatically.

## How the Gameplay Feels

As soon as the player spawns, the game begins. Static, falling, rolling, moving, and rotating obstacles make it challenging to complete the course with the highest score. If the player hits an obstacle, it is painted red, making it easier to track the success of the current run. The game ends once the player reaches the finish point, at which point the score is displayed.

## Possible Improvements/Bugfixes

- Time-consuming: Procedural obstacle generation
  - When combined with ArenaController’s automated adjustments, this can make each level unique and challenging
- Player can't jump from obstacle, only from the ground

## Reflection

I originally created this game before a school assignment, but since it was my first Unity project, I didn’t accomplish much. It had many bugs and too many unorganized objects, making it difficult to work with.

For this assignment, I put in the effort to fix almost all the bugs and improve the overall structure. I focused on a few interesting yet simple mechanics, and introducing prefabs and inheritance made managing objects in the scene much easier.

I am also proud of ArenaController which simplifies controlling all arena parts directly from the Unity Inspector. Previously, changing one object required manually adjusting many others, which was frustrating and time-consuming.
Now, everything updates automatically, saving both time and effort.
