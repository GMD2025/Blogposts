These weeks, we've been working hard...  
We have developed a nice schedule - every Tuesday, I come from Aarhus and stay overnight, so this gives us two halves of a day solely for game development.

TLDR - Most significant changes:
- Consistent design
- Huge architectural leaps
- Now we can simply choose which controls to use: either mouse or keyboard only (potentially, the mouse will converge with touch)
- Buildings now cost money!

Ultimately, the things on top are things we have done  
Although there is some hidden work: a lot of effort is put into thinking.  
We had to think in advance of how to make things scalable, how to implement state sharing for local 2-player mode (played on the same machine in the same instance of a game) and over a network (in case we want to support both. the network one is the preference though). Time spent on refactoring as well, as the codebase rose, the old tactics of categorizations that we've been using have become too cumbersome.

#### Update:
We have managed to do the network connections using NetCode - a library that provides high-level API and enables to sharing GameObjects rather than some state files. At this point, we can create a host and connect as a client as well.  
Although it came with a hard and willy decision - at least at this point in time, we think that we are not gonna implement split screen playing mode (which has been thought of only for the sake of Arcade machine, cause originally the idea of the game was to play over the network from mobile). It feels that we are wasting too much effort on making an Arcade Machine specific solution, whilist instead we would like to focus on actually having a nice game to play, which, coincidentally, can be played on the Arcade Machine as well. 
It was a tough decision indeed, at least because we spent so much time discussing the possibilities of how to do that, until the very last idea came - not to implement the split screen at all - solves everything. We are thinking that one player would be on Arcade Machine, while the second one is going to play from another device.  
We still haven't dropped this idea completely. Just set the priorities differently now. So maybe if we would have time later in May... (which never actually happens)
